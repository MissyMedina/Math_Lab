# 🚀 Math Lab - GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## 🔧 **Current Issue: Pages Not Enabled**

Your Math Lab deployment is failing because GitHub Pages needs to be manually enabled in your repository settings.

## ✅ **Step-by-Step Fix**

### **Method 1: Enable GitHub Pages (Recommended)**

1. **Go to your repository**: https://github.com/MissyMedina/Math_Lab.git

2. **Click "Settings" tab** (at the top of the repository page)

3. **Find "Pages" in the left sidebar** and click it

4. **Under "Source"**, you'll see a dropdown - select one of these options:
   - **"Deploy from a branch"** → Select `gh-pages` branch (if available)
   - **"GitHub Actions"** → This will use our workflow

5. **Click "Save"**

6. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for GitHub to process the change

7. **Your site will be available at**: `https://missymedina.github.io/Math_Lab/`

### **Method 2: Manual Branch Deployment**

If Method 1 doesn't work, try this:

1. **Go to Settings → Pages**
2. **Select "Deploy from a branch"**
3. **Choose "main" branch**
4. **Select "/ (root)" folder**
5. **Click "Save"**

Your site will deploy directly from the main branch.

## 🎯 **What Happens After Enabling Pages**

Once Pages is enabled:

✅ **Automatic Deployment**: Every push to `main` branch will update your live site

✅ **Live URL**: Your Math Lab will be available at `https://missymedina.github.io/Math_Lab/`

✅ **Mobile Optimized**: The site will work perfectly on all devices

✅ **No Server Needed**: Pure client-side application, works offline after first load

## 📱 **Testing Your Live Site**

Once deployed, test these features:

### **Desktop Testing**
- Navigate between all sections (Polynomial, Algebra, Geometry, Calculus, My Tutor)
- Try problem generators in each section
- Test My Tutor with a function problem like "f(x) = 1 - x + x²"
- Use student workspaces and save work

### **Mobile Testing**
- Open on your phone: `https://missymedina.github.io/Math_Lab/`
- Test hamburger menu navigation
- Try My Tutor system on mobile
- Test workspaces with touch keyboard
- Verify all buttons are touch-friendly

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### **If Pages Still Won't Enable:**

1. **Check Repository Visibility**: Make sure your repo is public (Pages requires public repos for free accounts)

2. **Try Different Source**: Switch between "GitHub Actions" and "Deploy from a branch"

3. **Wait and Retry**: Sometimes GitHub needs a few minutes to process changes

4. **Check Actions Tab**: Look for any error messages in the Actions tab

### **If Deployment Fails:**

1. **Check the Actions tab** in your repository for error details

2. **Look for red X marks** next to workflow runs

3. **Click on failed runs** to see detailed error messages

4. **Common fixes**:
   - Make sure all files are committed and pushed
   - Verify the workflow file is in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
   - Check that your repository is public

## 🎉 **Success Indicators**

You'll know it's working when:

✅ **Green checkmark** appears next to your latest commit

✅ **Actions tab** shows successful workflow runs

✅ **Settings → Pages** shows a green checkmark with your live URL

✅ **Your site loads** at `https://missymedina.github.io/Math_Lab/`

## 📞 **If You Need Help**

If you're still having issues:

1. **Check the Actions tab** for specific error messages
2. **Try the manual branch deployment** (Method 2 above)
3. **Verify your repository is public**
4. **Wait 5-10 minutes** after making changes

## 🎯 **Expected Result**

Once working, your Math Lab will be:

- **Live at**: `https://missymedina.github.io/Math_Lab/`
- **Fully functional** with all features working
- **Mobile optimized** for phones and tablets
- **Automatically updated** when you push changes
- **Available 24/7** for students worldwide

## 🚀 **Quick Summary**

**The fix is simple**: Go to your repository Settings → Pages → Enable Pages with either "GitHub Actions" or "Deploy from a branch" (main branch).

**That's it!** Your comprehensive Math Lab platform will then be live and accessible to students everywhere.
